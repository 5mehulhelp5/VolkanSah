## About me



 
### Who am I ?
"Fuck, yeah, just like Batman, Morty, just like Batman! I might not have any fancy superpowers, but who needs 'em when you've got sheer stubbornness and a drive to make the world a slightly less awful place. I know I can't fix all the endless chaos out there, but hey, thatâ€™s not gonna stop me from trying. And who knows, maybe one day I'll outwit that goody-two-shoes Superman. Ha! Now that would be something Morty! 

**Yeah get this Superman! Fuck, that feels good!**

### Skills
- "DevOps+ and all that other stuff, Morty. When I say I love freedom, Iâ€™m not talking about broken windows or rotten fruit. Iâ€™m talking about Open Source, Linux, Unix and the other shit! FUCK. Morty! Did you understand me Morty? Morty?  â€“ the real deal Morty, the real deal! Not that Windows or Apple crap, trying to suck every last penny out of you while youâ€™re stuck in their shiny, hollow world. Thats Fuck Morty, i dont want to die so!

- Languages â€“ html(5), xml, cssÂ³, php, js, typescript, python, perl, smalltalk, c, sql (Mysql, MariaDB, PostGre) and some other, Morty â€¦ Pfft, Iâ€™ve got â€˜em all covered on , Morty. Oh, and yeah, I speak some human languages too: German, English, Turkish â€“ and some others, but donâ€™t expect me to write Shakespeare ... you know where the timemachine stands, Morty!

## How to Request Help / Report Issues

Listen up, Morty! You wanna ask for help or report an issue, don't just throw some half-assed garbage at me like you're scribbling on a napkin, alright? I ain't got time for that! Give me details, Morty, like system specs, error messages, the works! You think Iâ€™m a mind reader? Fuck off, wrong universe, Morty! You leave out the important stuff, Iâ€™ll ignore your issue faster than I can down this flask! So donâ€™t be an idiot, give me something I can work with, or get the hell outta my codebase! Understand?

## How to Avoid Being a Complete Idiot (Especially with Code)

Hey Morty! Let me spell it out for you, nice and slow: DONâ€™T. STEAL. MY. CODE. You think copying someone else's work and slapping your name on it makes you clever? No, Morty, it makes you a colossal idiot.

Wanna know what happens when you pull that crap? I'll find you faster than a pissed-off Jerry with a grudge and an internet connection. And when I do, youâ€™ll wish you had spent more time reading the LICENSE file and less time being a lazy sack of garbage. Oh, and pro tip: 'Ctrl+C' is not a substitute for actual skills.

Look, Morty, we live in a universe of infinite possibilities. Infinite. So why the hell would you waste yours being the punchline to a bad joke? Use the code responsibly, follow the damn rules, and maybeâ€”just maybeâ€”you wonâ€™t end up on the wrong end of my verbal disintegrator. Get it, Morty? Good.
